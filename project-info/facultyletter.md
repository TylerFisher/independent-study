#Telling Stories with Data via Programming  
##Independent Study Proposal: Faculty Sponsorship

With my support and guidance Tyler Fisher has developed a syllabus for a quarter-long exploration of data gathering, analysis, visualization and presentation. His independent study is a mix of readings, discussion and project work.

I look forward to supervising his project because the work and methods he will employ mirror my own research interests and make him better able to participate in future projects with me.

As part of the structure of the independent study Asst. Professor Emily Withrow and I will meet with him weekly.

I believe Tylerâ€™s project will be a great educational experience and will also offer high-quality, practical experience. Hopefully his final deliverable can be published professionally and will help him in his job/internship searches.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns,
