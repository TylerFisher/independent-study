# Week 1-2 Summary #

## Books Read, Lessons Learned  ##

#### *Precision Journalism* ####

*Precision Journalism* worked really well as an introductory reading, and changed the way I should be thinking about the data project as a whole. Most importantly, Meyer hammers home that journalism is a science, and as practicioners of a science, we should be making hypotheses and testing them. That, in the end, is the power of data journalism: we can make predictions and test them. I would be interested to hear Meyer's opinion of the impact of getting a prediction wrong, especially today when your mistake can be quickly amplified through real-time social networking. Simple examples include CNN's misinterpretation of the Supreme Court justice ruling on healthcare, but what if you provide an overly simplistic analysis of crime data or mislead through a poorly designed graph? Is there more pressure to get it right?

#### Visualize This, ch. 1-3 ####

Chapters 1-3 were more introductory in nature, and I knew most of the things that Yau said. That being said, Yau explained designed a web scraper better than anything else I've ever read, and really simplifies the process by using [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), a Python package that makes web scraping really, really simple. I'm probably going to need to do some scraping to gather my data, so it's helpful that Yau explains it so simply and makes the process easy. I'm excited to move onto the later chapters this week, where Yau talks more about the design underlying specific types of data visualization, which is probably the area of this whole thing that I am weakest in. 

## Learning the Language ##

I worked through Part I and some of Part II of *R in Action*. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of longform examples in the book. Everything he teaches you is taught in isolation, which works great as a reference book, but not so much as something where you can go cover to cover and learn R quickly. That being said, I have picked up the syntax of R and I know how to list and store data in all types of data that R can handle: vectores, matrices, arrays, and especially data frames. Storing data in R is pretty similar to other programming languages; its syntax is just obviously older and stranger in comparison to a more modern web programming language like Python or Ruby.

I can also manage data and transform it, creating new table columns after performing mathematical operations on it, such as summing columns or finding averages of different columns. I have basic methods for filling in or ignoring missing data values, though this is something I should investigate further should the issue arise.

I also learned how to plot data and edit the plots so that they look like I want them to, including boxplots, scatterplots, histograms, line plots, and more. I didn't spend a terrible amount of time on this because I'm not making my R graphics for production and publication. I'm making them for personal use to analyze the data and find trends. Thus, I know how to plot and edit the plots for my own use and for presentation to select people.

More importantly, I learned how to compute basic statistical methods, such as summary statistics and regression lines. This is crucial for me: I'm using R to find the trends and find the story. R will help me find exactly which points of data are interesting through computing statistical methods for me. I have plenty more to learn, and the good thing about *R in Action* is that it goes into very advanced statistics (well beyond my own mathematical knowledge), and I can reference whatever method I might need quickly. The format of the book is useful for that, now that I've worked through the basics of R.
